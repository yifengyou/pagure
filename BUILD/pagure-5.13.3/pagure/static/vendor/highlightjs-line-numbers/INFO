This is a slightly patched version of the Highlightjs-line-numbers plugin from
https://github.com/wcoder/highlightjs-line-numbers.js

Downstream repo: https://pagure.io/pagure-highlightjs-line-numbers.js

It adds some additional classes and links on the line numbers to get some stuff
in Pagure working and disables inline style tag injection to avoid CSP errors

This files version comes from this commit: https://pagure.io/pagure-highlightjs-line-numbers.js/c/8670cf96d705da31343133785630c2fea7faed67
